Getting Started
- 
In GitHub, use the clone button to download the game source code. Then, open the index.html file in your browser and the game should start - if not check console for any issues. The images used in this game are stored in the images folder and are all png files.

Motivation
- 
- I completed this project in a pair. After a brainstorming session, we decided that we wanted to create an application that would both give instructions for making cocktails and also 
provide inspiration in the form of a random cocktail generator.

Application Architecture
- 
- The user can choose two options from the site's homepage; either, search for a cocktail, or, select the random cocktail button.
- After, the user will have access to information on the cocktail that they have chosen or that has been selected for them. This information is provided by 'TheCocktailDB' and includes the full name of the drink and its list of ingredients.

Challenges and future improvement
-
- The main challenge of this project was to create a user-friendly application that would provide them with great cocktail information.
- I would like to change the four images on the home page to be randomly-generated with hyperlinks to cocktails
- I would like to add a voting system to create a list of favourite cocktails.
