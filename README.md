# project-02
This was my second project of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course (Week 6).

Virtual Bartender
-
- The objective of this project was to build a React application that consumes a public API


Built With
- 
1. React
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. RESTful API
5. axios
6. bulma
7. GitHub

Deployment
- 
- This application is deployed on GitHub Pages and it can be found here: 

Getting Started
- 
In GitHub, use the clone button to download the game source code. Then, open the index.html file in your browser and the game should start - if not check console for any issues. The images used in this game are stored in the images folder and are all png files.


Motivation
- 
- I completed this project in a pair. After a brainstorming session, we decided that we wanted to create an application that would both give instructions for making cocktails and also 
provide inspiration in the form of a random cocktail generator. 

Application Architecture
- 
- The user can choose two options from the site's homepage; either, search for a cocktail, or, select the random cocktail button.
- After, the user will have access to information on the cocktail that they have chosen or that has been selected for them. This information is provided by 'TheCocktailDB' and includes the full name of the drink and its list of ingredients.


Challenges and future improvement
-
- The main challenge of this project was to create a user-friendly application that would provide them with great cocktail information.
- I would like to change the four images on the home page to be randomly-generated with hyperlinks to cocktails
- I would like to add a voting system to create a list of favourite cocktails.

Features
What makes your project stand out?

Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

API Reference
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

How to use?
- Snake is a simple game that uses four buttons (up, down, left, right). To move the snake press one of the four buttons to navigate towards the apple. Each apple you eat adds one point to your score and a new apple will be randomly generated. The game ends if the snake hits the perimeter of the grid or itself. 

Contribute
- Use the clone button to download the game source code. Open the index.html file in your browser and the game should start, if not check console for any issues. The images used in this game are stored in the images folder and are all png files.
